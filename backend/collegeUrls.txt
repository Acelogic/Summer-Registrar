// How to find more sites.
// To find a specific college's site, the best way is probably use Google
// Just google search for ["Dynamic Schedule" site:neu.edu] or ["ellucian" site:neu.edu] and it will likely come up
// but not allways.

// Other way that is scalable is to rdns their main hostname (neu.edu -> 155.33.17.68)
// Then do a whois lookup on that ip (whois 155.33.17.68) to get the netrange (155.33.0.0/16)
// all of these IP addresses are owned by NEU
// Then scan all of them for any server that has port 443 open
// and check to see if it the server running the registration system
// can check for link to https://<ip here>/css/web_defaultapp.css
// which is the same for all the links
// Two ways to rdns: actual rdns, and then look at the https cert for the url it presented. 
// Was able to go from dccc.edu to their site with this method. Will take longer for bigger schools. 


// Some other ways to find subdomains:
// Wolfram alpha, but idk if they have an free API and it is not a full list, idk where they are getting the data from
// https://github.com/faizann24/XssPy
//     Havent looked into this much. 
//     They mentioned that they have some way of getting subdomains though. Looks like it just spiders the site, which can totally work. 
//     Some sites have robots.txt set to deny so Google and Bing do not spider it.
